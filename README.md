# Simple String Encrypt

A modernized version of the ZCrypt String Encryption Tool made by zerosum0x0 in 2017. They gave permission to use the code.

I cleaned up the original code and made some tweaks. My intention was to provide an easy and accessible string encryption example for everyone. The only C# compatible tools for this task I found are hidden behind a paywall. One of these paid tools is even an almost exact copy of ZCrypt which gave me the motivation to create this little mod.
